### 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Zen — a commercial manager who’s learning web development alongside my day job.  
I’m exploring coding out of curiosity and to see what kinds of projects I might enjoy building or freelancing on in the future.

- 🌱 Currently learning: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript basics**  
- 💡 Interested in: how websites are built and how to make them look and work better  
- 🎯 Goal: complete beginner projects and build a small portfolio  
- 💬 Open to: chatting with other learners and career-switchers in tech

### 🚧 Currently Working On

- Building my first **HTML + CSS portfolio page**  
- Completing the **Scrimba Frontend Developer Path**  
- Experimenting with small JavaScript practice projects  
- Learning how to use **GitHub** properly for version control
